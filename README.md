# raspberries

Repo to contain all the scripts, configs, and instructions I use to build out my RPi cluster. I've built one several \
times before without documentation and it's always a mess to bring it back online if anything goes wrong. Hopefully \
this will resolve that issue for future screwups.

My goals with this project are *Agile* and subject to change. I aim to write this so that anyone reading it may understand.

## Goals

✔️: Free space\
❌: Ansible playbook to configure Pis\
❌: PiHole running\
❌: K3s running\
